 * This is a little project that I am undertaking to force myself to learn
 * GUI programming (again, because I haven't done it in a long while). I hope
 * implementing the game logic will be a good distraction from the basic, boring,
 * repetitive routine of GUI programming. Also, I hope the reward of seeing my final
 * project will also be worth it.
